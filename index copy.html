        I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
        Gotta make you understand
        Never gonna give you up
        Never gonna let you down
        Never gonna run around and desert you
        Never gonna make you cry
        Never gonna say goodbye
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
        We've known each other for so long
        Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
        Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
        We know the game and we're gonna play it
